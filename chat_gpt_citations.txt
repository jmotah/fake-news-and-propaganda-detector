    PROMPT: How to use pandas read_csv to read a tsv file?
    ANSWER: 
        """
        To read a TSV (tab-separated values) file using pandas.read_csv, you just need to specify the separator (sep) as '\t' (the tab character). Here’s how:

        import pandas as pd

        # Read the TSV file
        df = pd.read_csv('your_file.tsv', sep='\t')

        # Preview the data
        print(df.head())

        Notes:
	        •	Replace 'your_file.tsv' with the path to your file.
	        •	If your TSV file doesn’t have headers, add header=None to the function call.
	        •	You can also use delimiter='\t' instead of sep='\t'; both work the same.

        Let me know if your file has special characteristics (like encoding, quotes, etc.), and I can adjust the parameters.
